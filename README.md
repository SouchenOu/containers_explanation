To remember:
-----------


There are two ways we can implement templates:

Function Templates
Class Templates

Similar to function templates, we can use class templates to create a single class to work with different data types.

  Class Template Declaration:
  
  A class template starts with the keyword template followed by template parameter(s) inside <> which is followed by the class declaration.

               template <class T>
               class className 
               {
                 private:
                      T var;
                      ... .. ...
                 public:
                      T functionName(T arg);
                       ... .. ...
              };

In the above declaration, T is the template argument which is a placeholder for the data type used, and class is a keyword.


Once we've declared and defined a class template, we can create its objects in other classes or functions (such as the main() function) with the following syntax

className<dataType> classObject;
  
For example,

className<int> classObject;
  
className<float> classObject;
  
className<string> classObject;




What is a data structures:
--------------------------


A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.

Containers in C++ STL (Standard Template Library)
-------------------------------------------------

A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows great flexibility in the types supported as elements. 

The container manages the storage space for its elements and provides member functions to access them, either directly or through iterators (reference objects with similar properties to pointers). 

1:array: Static contiguous array (class template)

2:vector: Dynamic contiguous array (class template)

3:deque: Double-ended queue (class template)

4:forward_list: Singly-linked list (class template)

5:list: Doubly-linked list (class template)

6:Set: Collection of unique keys, sorted by keys  (class template)

7:Map: Collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys, keys are unique (class template).

8:multiset: Collection of keys, sorted by keys (class template)

9:multimap: Collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys (class template)


10:unordered_set: Collection of unique keys, hashed by keys. (class template)

11:unordered_map: Collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys, keys are unique. (class template)

12:unordered_multiset: Collection of keys, hashed by keys (class template)

13:unordered_multimap: Collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys (class template)

4:stack: Adapts a container to provide stack (LIFO data structure) (class template).

15:queue: Adapts a container to provide queue (FIFO data structure) (class template).

16:priority_queue: Adapts a container to provide priority queue (class template). 


namespace in C++
-----------------------

A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries. 
 
 
          namespace ContosoData
          {
              class ObjectManager
              {
                 public:
                    void DoSomething() {}
              };
              void Func(ObjectManager) {}
          }
          
          
          EXP:
          
           ContosoData::ObjectManager mgr;
           
           mgr.DoSomething();
           
           ContosoData::Func(mgr);
    
    
std::allocator() in C++
-----------------------

Allocators are objects responsible for encapsulating memory management. std::allocator is used when you want to separate allocation and do construction in two steps. It is also used when separate destruction and deallocation is done in two steps. All the STL containers in C++ have a type parameter Allocator that is by default std::allocator. The default allocator simply uses the operators new and delete to obtain and release memory. 

Member functions associated with std::allocator() :

1:address: It is used for obtaining the address of an object although it is removed in C++20.

2:construct: It is used to construct an object.It is also removed in C++20.

3:destroy: It is used to destruct an object in allocated storage.It is also removed in C++20.

4:max_size: It returns the largest supported allocation size.It is deprecated in C++17 and removed in C++20.

5:allocate: Used for allocation of memory.

6:deallocate: Used for deallocation of memory.


As we know all the STL containers in C++ have an Allocator as a type parameter which is std::allocator by default. Underlying, it uses the new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate memory.

By definition, allocators are objects responsible for encapsulating memory management. It is useful when we want to separate memory allocation and object construction in two steps and separate deallocation and object destruction in two steps as well.

So what does this mean? For example, consider the following code:

                    int* vPtr = new int[3];
                    
With new operator, it forces us to allocate and construct all objects, 3 integer values, at the same time. Letâ€™s say we only want to allocate (or preserve) 3 integer size memory areas and construct these integer values later, for instance we only want to construct the first integer value. std::allocator can help us to do that.

Allocators :

The allocator is responsible for managing raw memory storage and also for constructing and destroying allocated objects in two seperated steps. Its declaration is:

template <class T> class allocator;
 
The most advantage of using allocator is:

Allocator allow us to have control over which constructors are called so the allocation and constructor are seperated.
 
 
                   #include <memory>
                   #include <iostream>
                   #include <string>
 
                  int main()
                  {
                     std::allocator<int> intAlloc;
                     // Allocate memory area for 100 integers
                     int* intArray = intAlloc.allocate(100);
                     // Construct the 5th element
                     intArray[4] = 2011;
                     std::cout << "intArray[4]: " << intArray[4] << std::endl;
                     // Deallocate the memory area
                     intAlloc.deallocate(intArray, 100);
                  }
                  
 typedef in C++
 ---------------
                  
typedef keyword in C++ is used for aliasing existing data types, user-defined data types, and pointers to a more meaningful name.                 
                  
The typedef in C/C++ is a keyword used to assign alternative names to the existing datatypes. It is mostly used with user-defined datatypes when the naming of the predefined datatypes becomes slightly complicated to use in programs.                 
                  
  
 
 The keyword typename:
 ---------------------
 
The keyword typename was introduced to specify that the identifier that follows is a type. Consider the following example:

                      template <class T>
                      Class MyClass
                      {
                         typename T::SubType * ptr;
                            ...
                      };
Here, typename is used to clarify that SubType is a type of class T. Thus, ptr is a pointer to the type T::SubType. Without typename, SubType would be considered a static member. Thus

                        T::SubType * ptr
 
would be a multiplication of value SubType of type T with ptr.
 
 
 Use of explicit keyword in C++ :
 ------------------------------
 
Explicit Keyword in C++ is used to mark constructors to not implicitly convert types in C++. It is optional for constructors that take exactly one argument and work on constructors(with a single argument) since those are the only constructors that can be used in typecasting.
 

                 class String 
                 {
                     public:
                         String(int n); // allocate n bytes to the String object
                         String(const char *p); // initializes object with char *p
                 };
Now, if you try:

                      String mystring = 'x';
 
The character 'x' will be implicitly converted to int and then the String(int) constructor will be called. But, this is not what the user might have intended. So, to prevent such conditions, we shall define the constructor as explicit:

                 class String 
                 {
                    public:
                         explicit String (int n); //allocate n bytes
                         String(const char *p); // initialize sobject with string p
                 };
 
 
 
 
1: Vectors:
 ----------
 
 In this tutorial, we will learn about vectors in C++ with the help of examples.

In C++, vectors are used to store elements of similar data types. However, unlike arrays, the size of a vector can grow dynamically.

That is, we can change the size of the vector during the execution of a program as per our requirements.

Vectors are part of the C++ Standard Template Library. To use vectors, we need to include the vector header file in our program.
 
 
         #include <vector>
 
1-1:  -C++ Vector Initialization
 --------------------------------
 
Method 1:

           vector<int> vector1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 
 Method 2 :
 
           vector<int> vector3(5, 12);
 
           This one equivalent to 
 
           vector<int> vector3 = {12, 12, 12, 12, 12};

 
 
 
 
 
 code example:
 
 
                      #include <iostream>
                      #include <vector>
                      using namespace std;

                      int main() 
                      {

                                // initializer list
                                   vector<int> vector1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

                               // uniform initialization
                                  vector<int> vector2{6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

                              // method 3
                                 vector<int> vector3(5, 12);

                                 cout << "vector1 = ";

                            // ranged loop
                                 for (const int& i : vector1) 
                                 {
                                     cout << i << "  ";
                                 }

                                cout << "\nvector2 = ";

                          // ranged loop
                                for (const int& i : vector2) 
                                {
                                    cout << i << "  ";
                                }

                                cout << "\nvector3 = ";

                         // ranged loop
                               for (int i : vector3) 
                               {
                                   cout << i << "  ";
                               }

                                  return 0;
                       }
 
 
 
vector::vector (constructors)
 ----------------------------
 
1:    explicit vector (const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());

2:    explicit vector (size_type n, const value_type& val = value_type(),const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());

3:    vector (const vector& x);
 
 
                  
                  alloc: Allocator object,The container keeps and uses an internal copy of this allocator.
                  Member type allocator_type is the internal allocator type used by the container, defined in vector as an alias of its second template                   parameter (Alloc).
                  If allocator_type is an instantiation of the default allocator (which has no state), this is not relevant.
                  
                  n: Initial container size (i.e., the number of elements in the container at construction). 
                  Member type size_type is an unsigned integral type.
 
                  val: Value to fill the container with. Each of the n elements in the container will be initialized to a copy of this value.
                  Member type value_type is the type of the elements in the container, defined in vector as an alias of its first template parameter                       (T).


 
 1-2: - Basic Vector Operations:
 -------------------------------
 
 1:Add elements
 
 2:Access elements
 
 3:Change elements
 
 4:Remove elements
 
       -------------------------------
       1:  Add Elements to a Vector :
       -------------------------------
 
       vector<int>vect{1,2,3};
       vect.push_back(22);
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       Note: We can also use the insert() and emplace() functions to add elements to a vector.
 
       -----------------------
       2:   Access elements :
       -----------------------
 
        In C++, we use the index number to access the vector elements. Here, we use the at() function to access the element from the specified index.           For example,
 
         vector<int> num {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
         num.at(3); // means give me the number at position 3
 
 
 
 
         Note: Like an array, we can also use the square brackets [] to access vector elements. For example,

         vector<int> num {1, 2, 3};
         cout << num[1];
 
          However, the at() function is preferred over [] because at() throws an exception whenever the vector is out of bound, while [] gives a garbage           value.

          vector<int> num {1, 2, 3};

          // gives garbage value
             cout << num[4];

          // throws an exception
             cout << num.at(4);
      
        -----------------------------
        3:  Change Vector Element :
        -----------------------------
 
 
        We can change an element of the vector using the same at() function. For example,
   
          num.at(1) = 9;
          num.at(4) = 7;
 
        --------------------------------------
        4: Delete Elements from C++ Vectors :
        --------------------------------------
 
         To delete a single element from a vector, we use the pop_back() function. For example,
 
          // remove the last element
             prime_numbers.pop_back();
      
1-3: C++ Vector Functions
-------------------------
 
 In C++, the vector header file provides various functions that can be used to perform different operations on a vector.
 
1:size()	returns the number of elements present in the vector
 
2: clear()	removes all the elements of the vector
 
3: front()	returns the first element of the vector
 
4: back()	returns the last element of the vector
 
5: empty()	returns 1 (true) if the vector is empty
 
6: capacity()	check the overall size of a vector
 
 1-4: C++ Vector Iterators:
 ---------------------------
 
 Vector iterators are used to point to the memory address of a vector element. In some ways, they act like pointers in C++.
 
 We can create vector iterators with the syntax

 vector<T>::iterator iteratorName;
 
          // iterator for int vector
 
             vector<int>::iterator iter1;

         // iterator for double vector
 
            vector<double>::iterator iter2;

           1: Initialize Vector Iterators
           ------------------------------
 
           We can initialize vector iterators using the begin() and end() functions.
            
                  begin() function:
                  ------------------

                  The begin() function returns an iterator that points to the first element of the vector. For example,

                  vector<int> num = {1, 2, 3};
                  vector<int>::iterator iter;

                  // iter points to num[0]
                  iter = num.begin();
 
                 end() function:
                 ---------------

                 The end() function points to the theoretical element that comes after the final element of the vector. For example,

                 // iter points to the last element of num
                 iter = num.end() - 1;

 
 
 
 vector class:
 -------------
 
The C++ Standard Library vector class is a class template for sequence containers. A vector stores elements of a given type in a linear arrangement, and allows fast random access to any element. A vector is the preferred container for a sequence when random-access performance is at a premium.

 Some of functions  i used it to implement vector functions: 
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 1 - destroy(): 
 
In C++, the operator delete destroys an object by calling its destructor, and then deallocates the memory where that object was stored. Occasionally, however, it is useful to separate those two operations. [1] Destroy calls an object's destructor without deallocating the memory where the object was stored.
 
 we use it to Change size
 
                           void resize (size_type n, value_type val = value_type());

 
Resizes the container so that it contains n elements.

If n is smaller than the current container size, the content is reduced to its first n elements, removing those beyond (and destroying them).

If n is greater than the current container size, the content is expanded by inserting at the end as many elements as needed to reach a size of n. If val is specified, the new elements are initialized as copies of val, otherwise, they are value-initialized.

If n is also greater than the current container capacity, an automatic reallocation of the allocated storage space takes place.

Notice that this function changes the actual content of the container by inserting or erasing elements from it.
 
2 - construct():
 
 
                         void construct( pointer p, const_reference val );
 
this function provides the automatic fall back to placement new, the member function construct() is an optional Allocator requirement since C++11. 
 
The function constructs an object of member type value_type (an alias of allocator's template parameter) using its copy constructor to initialize its value to a copy of val, as if the following code was used:
new ((void*)p) value_type (val);
 
 
 
3 - allocate() :
 
 
                       pointer allocate (size_type n, allocator<void>::const_pointer hint=0);

 
Attempts to allocate a block of storage with a size large enough to contain n elements of member type value_type (an alias of the allocator's template parameter), and returns a pointer to the first element.
 
In the standard default allocator, the block of storage is allocated using ::operator new one or more times, and throws bad_alloc if it cannot allocate the total amount of storage requested.




4 - deallocate() :


                      void deallocate (pointer p, size_type n);

Releases a block of storage previously allocated with member allocate and not yet released.

The elements in the array are not destroyed by a call to this member function.

In the default allocator, the block of storage is at some point deallocated using ::operator delete (either during the function call, or later).

 5 - distance() :
 
The distance() function in C++ helps find the distance between two iterators. In other words, we can use this function to calculate the number of elements present between the two iterators. This function is available in the <iterator> header file.






The difference between size , max_size and capacity :
-----------------------------------------------------


----size:

Returns the number of elements in the vector container.

This is the number of actual objects held in the vector, which is not necessarily equal to its storage capacity. Vectors automatically reallocate their storage space when needed or when requested with member resize. To retrieve the current storage capacity of a vector you can call to its member capacity.

----capacity:

Returns the size of the allocated storage space for the elements of the vector container.

Notice that, in vectors, the capacity is not necessarily equal to the number of elements that conform the underlying vector content (this can be obtained with member vector::size), but the capacity of the actual allocated space, which is either equal or greater than the content size.

Notice also that this capacity does not suppose a limit to the size of the vector. If more space is required to accomodate new elements in the vector, the capacity is automatically expanded, or can even be explicitly modified by calling member vector::reserve.

The real limit on the size a vector object can reach is returned by member vector::max_size.

----max_size:

Returns the maximum number of elements that the vector container can hold.

This is not the amount of storage space currently allocated to the vector (this can be obtained with member vector::capacity), but the maximum potential size the vector could reach due to system or library implementation limitations.



What is red_black_tree :
------------------------

In computer science, a redâ€“black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores an extra bit representing "color" ("red" or "black"), used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.

Introduction:

When it comes to searching and sorting data, one of the most fundamental data structures is the binary search tree. However, the performance of a binary search tree is highly dependent on its shape, and in the worst case, it can degenerate into a linear structure with a time complexity of O(n). This is where Red Black Trees come in, they are a type of balanced binary search tree that use a specific set of rules to ensure that the tree is always balanced. This balance guarantees that the time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is always O(log n), regardless of the initial shape of the tree.

Red Black Trees are self-balancing, meaning that the tree adjusts itself automatically after each insertion or deletion operation. It uses a simple but powerful mechanism to maintain balance, by coloring each node in the tree either red or black. 

Rules That Every Red-Black Tree Follows: 

Every node has a color either red or black.

The root of the tree is always black.

There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).

Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendants NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.

 Every leaf (e.i. NULL node) must be colored BLACK.

  Some informations about red black tree :
  ---------------------------------------
  
  -All the left node should be less than the Root node.
  
  -All the right node should be greater than the root node.
  
  -The left node should be less than the previous node.
  
  -The right node should be greater than the previous node.
  
  
  -In binary search tree (The searching, deletion , insertion is going to take order f log in time O(log 2 n) in average case but in worst case is it O (n))

  so searching about  a data using red-black-tree it is going to take less time... that is why we use red-black-tree
